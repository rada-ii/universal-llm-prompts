Content to quiz: 
The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth's surface. It includes evaporation (water changing from liquid to gas), condensation (gas changing back to liquid), precipitation (rain, snow, sleet), and collection (water gathering in oceans, lakes, rivers). The sun provides energy that drives the water cycle. Plants also participate through transpiration, releasing water vapor through their leaves.
