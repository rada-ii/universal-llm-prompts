Decision context: Small marketing agency (8 employees) needs to choose a new project management tool to replace current system (basic spreadsheets and email)

Available options:
1. Asana - $25/month per user, comprehensive features
2. Trello - $10/month per user, simple board system  
3. Monday.com - $20/month per user, customizable workflows
4. Keep current system - $0, familiar but inefficient

Constraints: 
- Budget maximum $200/month
- Must integrate with current email system (Gmail)
- Team has mixed comfort levels with technology
- Need to implement within 30 days
- Cannot afford downtime during client projects

Stakeholders:
- Project managers (2 people) - want advanced features
- Creative team (4 people) - want simple, visual interface  
- Account managers (2 people) - need client communication features
- Owner - wants cost control and ROI
