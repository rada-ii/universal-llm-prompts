Our REST API supports user management with JWT authentication. Tokens expire after 24 hours and must be refreshed. Rate limiting allows 1000 requests per hour per API key. We only support JSON responses. Code examples are available in Python, JavaScript, and cURL. Premium accounts receive 10x higher rate limits (10,000/hour) and priority support. API documentation includes endpoint descriptions, request/response schemas, and error codes. Free tier users can make up to 100 requests per day.
