## The Prompt:

Help me solve this problem using step-by-step reasoning. Break down the situation, analyze different aspects, and provide a clear recommendation with your reasoning visible.

**Problem Description:**
[DESCRIBE YOUR CHALLENGE - example: "Should we hire a full-time developer or use freelancers for our app project?"]

**Context Information:**

- Current situation: [WHERE YOU ARE NOW - example: "Small startup, 5 employees, limited budget"]
- Constraints: [LIMITATIONS - example: "Must deliver in 6 months, budget under $80K"]
- Success criteria: [WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE - example: "High-quality app that can scale"]
- Stakeholders: [WHO'S AFFECTED - example: "Founders, existing team, future users"]

**Analysis Request:**
Walk me through your reasoning process:

1. **Problem Analysis:**

   - What are the core issues I need to consider?
   - What factors are most important for this decision?
   - What are the potential risks of each approach?

2. **Options Evaluation:**

   - What are my realistic options?
   - What are the pros and cons of each?
   - What assumptions am I making?

3. **Reasoning Process:**

   - How do the different factors weigh against each other?
   - What evidence supports each option?
   - Where might my thinking have blind spots?

4. **Recommendation:**
   - What's your recommended approach and why?
   - What would you do first to test this recommendation?
   - What could go wrong and how would you mitigate it?

Make your reasoning clear and show your work - I want to understand not just what you recommend, but how you arrived at that conclusion.

## Example Result:

**PROBLEM ANALYSIS**

Core Issues to Consider:
• Cost management vs. quality control
• Timeline flexibility vs. resource availability  
• Long-term scalability vs. short-term delivery
• Team integration vs. specialized expertise

Most Important Factors:

1. Budget constraints ($80K limit is firm)
2. Timeline requirement (6-month deadline)
3. Quality standards (app must be scalable)
4. Team capacity (5 people already fully committed)

Potential Risks:
• Full-time hire: High fixed costs, longer onboarding
• Freelancers: Quality variability, communication overhead

**OPTIONS EVALUATION**

Option 1: Hire Full-Time Developer
Pros: Better integration, consistent quality, long-term asset
Cons: $60-80K salary + benefits exceeds budget, 2-4 week hiring process
Assumptions: We can find quality developer quickly, they'll integrate well

Option 2: Use Freelancers
Pros: Lower cost, immediate start, specialized skills
Cons: Management overhead, potential quality issues, knowledge transfer
Assumptions: We can find reliable freelancers, manage remote work effectively

Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Part-time + Freelancers)
Pros: Balance of control and flexibility, risk mitigation
Cons: Complex management, potential coordination issues
Assumptions: We can find part-time technical lead, coordinate effectively

**REASONING PROCESS**

Factor Weight Analysis:
• Budget (Critical): Freelancers win significantly
• Timeline (High): Freelancers win (immediate start vs. 2-4 week hiring)
• Quality (High): Mixed - depends on freelancer selection and management
• Integration (Medium): Full-time wins, but not decisive given other factors

Evidence Supporting Each Option:
• Market data shows quality freelancers available in our tech stack
• Our current team has project management experience
• Budget math: Freelancers $40-60K vs. Full-time $80K+ total cost

Potential Blind Spots:
• Underestimating management overhead for freelancers
• Overestimating integration benefits of full-time hire
• Not considering partial solutions or creative arrangements

**RECOMMENDATION**

Recommended Approach: Hybrid model with experienced freelance lead + specialized freelancers

Reasoning:

1. Hire one senior freelance developer as technical lead (part-time, $40K)
2. Add specialized freelancers for UI/UX and backend as needed ($20-30K)
3. Keep total cost under $70K, leaving buffer for unexpected needs

This approach balances cost control with quality assurance while meeting timeline requirements.

First Step to Test:
Interview 3 senior freelance developers for technical lead role. Evaluate their communication skills, past project management experience, and technical expertise. Start with 2-week trial project.

Risk Mitigation:
• Weekly check-ins and milestone reviews
• Clear documentation requirements
• Backup freelancer candidates identified
• 20% budget buffer for scope changes

**CONFIDENCE LEVEL: Medium-High**
This recommendation addresses your core constraints while providing flexibility to adjust as the project progresses.

## Tips for Success:

1. **Be specific about constraints** - Clear limitations help generate better analysis
2. **Include stakeholder perspectives** - Consider who else is affected by your decision
3. **Ask for reasoning transparency** - Understanding the "why" helps you evaluate recommendations
4. **Test recommendations small** - Try approaches on smaller scale first when possible

## Common Use Cases:

- **Business decisions** - Hiring, product features, market expansion
- **Technical choices** - Architecture decisions, tool selection, process improvements
- **Strategic planning** - Resource allocation, timing, competitive responses
- **Problem diagnosis** - Understanding root causes, identifying solutions
