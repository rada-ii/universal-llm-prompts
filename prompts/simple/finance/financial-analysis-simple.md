## Example Result:

**FINANCIAL ANALYSIS REPORT - EQUIPMENT INVESTMENT**

**Executive Summary:**
The proposed $500K equipment investment shows strong financial merit with 22% ROI and 3.2-year payback. Investment will increase production capacity by 40% and reduce unit costs by 15%, supporting planned market expansion.

**FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE:**

- Current gross margin: 35% (industry average 32%)
- Strong cash flow: $300K quarterly operating cash flow
- Debt capacity: Can support additional $400K loan without exceeding 2:1 debt ratio
- Break-even analysis: Need 25% capacity utilization to cover equipment costs

**INVESTMENT ANALYSIS:**

- Expected ROI: 22% (exceeds 15% target)
- Payback period: 3.2 years (within acceptable range)
- Best case scenario: 28% ROI if demand exceeds projections
- Worst case scenario: 12% ROI if market growth slows

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
**APPROVE** the investment with staged implementation

1. Secure financing: Negotiate equipment loan at favorable terms
2. Phase implementation: Install 60% capacity initially, expand based on demand
3. Monitor metrics: Track utilization rates and unit cost reductions monthly

The investment aligns with growth strategy while maintaining financial discipline.

1. **Provide complete data** - More financial information = better analysis
2. **Define success clearly** - Specify ROI targets, payback periods, risk tolerance
3. **Include benchmarks** - Industry averages help evaluate performance
