**Date:** [DATE]
**Attendees:** [LIST OF PARTICIPANTS]
**Duration:** [HOW LONG]

**Key Decisions Made:**

Make sure all action items have clear owners and deadlines. If dates or responsibilities weren't specified in the original notes, indicate this clearly (e.g., "[Date TBD]" or "[Owner to be assigned]").

Format this so I can copy-paste it directly into an email to send to all meeting participants.
