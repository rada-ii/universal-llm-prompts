Hi Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. It was great meeting you at the Digital Marketing Summit last month and learning about TechCorp's expansion plans.

During our conversation, you mentioned that your team is looking for support with social media strategy for the Q2 product launch. I'd love to discuss how my expertise in B2B social campaigns could help you achieve your goals.

I've helped similar tech companies increase their social engagement by 150% and generate qualified leads through targeted LinkedIn and Twitter campaigns. Based on what you shared about your objectives, I believe I could create a strategy that aligns perfectly with your timeline and budget.

Would you be available for a brief 30-minute call next week to explore this further? I'm flexible with timing and can work around your schedule. I'd be happy to share some relevant case studies and discuss how we might approach your specific challenges.

Please let me know what works best for you. I look forward to continuing our conversation.

Best regards,
