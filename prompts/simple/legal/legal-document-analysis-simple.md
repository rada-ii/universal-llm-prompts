**LEGAL ANALYSIS SUMMARY**

**Document Overview:**
Software license renewal for project management platform. 3-year term at $36,000 annually (up from $30,000). Auto-renewal unless canceled with 90-day notice.

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- 20% price increase over current contract
- Vendor can increase prices up to 10% annually after year one
- You're responsible for unlimited liability if your employees cause data breaches
- Termination requires 6-month notice and penalty fee

**RED FLAGS:**
- Unlimited liability clause is unusual and risky
- Price increase cap is higher than industry standard (usually 3-5%)
- Long termination notice makes switching vendors difficult

**RECOMMENDATION:** NEGOTIATE before signing
- Request liability cap of $100,000 or annual contract value
- Reduce price increase limit to 5% annually
- Negotiate 90-day termination notice instead of 6 months

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Counter-propose with liability cap and price protection
2. Get quotes from 2 alternative vendors for leverage
3. Set deadline of January 20th for vendor response
