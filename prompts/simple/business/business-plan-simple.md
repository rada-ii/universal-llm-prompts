**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

PawPal revolutionizes pet care by connecting busy professionals with verified, insured pet sitters through our mobile platform. Unlike traditional pet boarding, our service provides in-home care with real-time monitoring, ensuring pets remain comfortable in familiar environments while owners travel with peace of mind.

Our target market consists of urban professionals aged 25-45 with household incomes above $75,000 who travel regularly for business. This demographic represents 12.3 million households in major metropolitan areas, spending an average of $1,200 annually on pet care services. Current solutions like boarding facilities create stress for pets and inconvenience for owners, while informal arrangements lack reliability and insurance protection.

Key Success Factors:
• Comprehensive background checks and insurance for all sitters
• Real-time GPS tracking and photo updates during visits
• Seamless booking platform with 24/7 customer support
• Competitive 15% commission structure attracting quality sitters
• Integration with veterinary services for emergency situations

We project reaching 10,000 active users within 18 months, generating $2.4M in annual revenue by year two. With proven traction in our initial test market and $250,000 in seed funding, PawPal is positioned to capture significant market share in the $24B pet care industry.
