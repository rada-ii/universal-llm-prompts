# Troubleshooting Guide

Having issues with prompts? This guide covers the most common problems and their solutions.

## Quick Fixes for Common Problems

### ü§ñ AI adds extra text before/after my JSON output

**Problem:** Getting explanations or formatting instead of clean JSON/CSV

```
Here's the analysis you requested:
{"title": "Developer", "company": "TechCorp"...}
Hope this helps!
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Use structured prompts only** - Don't use simple prompts for data extraction
2. **Set temperature to 0.1** - Higher temperatures cause creative additions
3. **Copy the entire prompt** - Don't modify or shorten structured prompts
4. **Try different AI platform** - Claude is often better for pure JSON output

**Platform-specific fixes:**

- **ChatGPT:** Add "Output only the JSON, no additional text" to end of prompt
- **Gemini:** Often adds explanations; try Claude or ChatGPT instead
- **Claude:** Usually good with structured output by default

### üìù Output doesn't match my needs exactly

**Problem:** Getting generic or irrelevant results

**Solutions:**

1. **Add specific examples** in your prompt:

   ```
   Instead of: "Write a business plan"
   Try: "Write a business plan for a mobile app that connects dog owners
   with pet sitters, targeting urban professionals who travel for work"
   ```

2. **Include context about your audience:**

   ```
   "Create this for busy executives who need quick, actionable insights"
   ```

3. **Specify the format you want:**

   ```
   "Format as an email I can send directly to my team"
   ```

4. **Give examples of what good looks like:**
   ```
   "Similar to how Airbnb connects hosts with travelers, but for pet care"
   ```

### üîÑ Inconsistent results across different AI platforms

**Problem:** Same prompt gives different quality results on different platforms

**Platform Strengths:**

- **ChatGPT 4:** Best for business documents, consistent formatting
- **Claude 3:** Excellent for long documents, analysis, and structured data
- **Gemini Pro:** Good for creative content, sometimes verbose
- **GPT-3.5:** Budget option, may need prompt adjustments

**Solutions:**

1. **Use compatibility headers** - Our structured prompts include these
2. **Test platform-specific versions:**

   - For ChatGPT: More direct instructions work better
   - For Claude: Longer, detailed prompts are fine
   - For Gemini: Shorter, focused prompts reduce verbosity

3. **Adjust for platform quirks:**
   - ChatGPT: Sometimes needs explicit format reminders
   - Claude: Excellent at following complex instructions
   - Gemini: May need "be concise" instruction

### ‚ùì Not sure which prompt to use for my situation

**Decision Tree:**

**Want a document humans will read?** ‚Üí Use Simple Prompts

- Business plans, lesson plans, emails, presentations

**Want data for spreadsheets/automation?** ‚Üí Use Structured Prompts

- Extract job info, classify content, analyze sentiment

**Need inspiration or brainstorming?** ‚Üí Use Simple Prompts with creative focus

- Blog outlines, social media content, marketing ideas

**Processing lots of data?** ‚Üí Use Structured Prompts

- Survey analysis, content classification, data extraction

**Check our examples:**

- Browse `tests/inputs/` for scenarios similar to yours
- Look at `EXAMPLES.md` for real outputs
- Try the closest match and adjust from there

### ‚è±Ô∏è Prompts are too slow or hit token limits

**Problem:** AI stops mid-response or takes too long

**Solutions:**

1. **Break large tasks into smaller parts:**

   ```
   Instead of: "Analyze this 50-page document"
   Try: "Analyze pages 1-10 of this document, focusing on key findings"
   ```

2. **Use more focused prompts:**

   ```
   Instead of: "Create a complete marketing strategy"
   Try: "Create a social media plan for the next 30 days"
   ```

3. **Prioritize your requests:**

   ```
   "Focus on the 3 most important recommendations"
   ```

4. **Use structured prompts for data tasks** - They're more efficient

---

### üéØ Results are too generic or obvious

**Problem:** Getting textbook answers instead of practical advice

**Solutions:**

1. **Add your specific constraints:**

   ```
   "Budget limited to $500/month, team of 2 people, B2B SaaS company"
   ```

2. **Request specific examples:**

   ```
   "Include 3 specific tools or tactics I can implement this week"
   ```

3. **Ask for personalization:**

   ```
   "Tailor this for a freelance graphic designer working with small businesses"
   ```

4. **Include your current situation:**
   ```
   "We're currently using spreadsheets and email, have 10 employees"
   ```

### üîß Technical prompts aren't working

**Problem:** Structured prompts returning errors or malformed data

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Using the exact prompt text (don't modify structured prompts)
- [ ] Set AI temperature to 0.1 or 0.2
- [ ] Copied entire prompt including compatibility headers
- [ ] Input data is in expected format
- [ ] Testing on ChatGPT 4 or Claude 3 (more reliable than others)

**Common fixes:**

1. **JSON validation errors:** Use an online JSON validator to check output
2. **CSV formatting issues:** Check for commas in data fields
3. **Missing fields:** Some platforms skip fields - specify "include all fields"
4. **Wrong data types:** Add type validation to your prompt

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### When Multiple Platforms Fail

1. **Check your input data:**

   - Is it clear and well-formatted?
   - Does it contain the information the prompt expects?
   - Try with our test inputs first

2. **Simplify your request:**

   - Remove optional elements
   - Focus on core functionality
   - Test with minimal example

3. **Check prompt compatibility:**
   - Are you mixing simple and structured prompt elements?
   - Did you modify a working prompt?
   - Try the original version first

### Performance Optimization

**For faster results:**

- Use shorter, more focused prompts
- Provide clear examples of desired output
- Avoid asking for multiple formats in one request

**For better quality:**

- Include specific context about your situation
- Give examples of good vs. bad outputs
- Use iterative refinement (start basic, then add details)
